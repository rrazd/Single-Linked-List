This is a project I did for my second year Data Structures and Algorithms
course. I added some extra functions for my own amusement. Although I
know I can optimize the code more, I am currently satisfied with it and
thus will let it rest in peace.

There are two .cpp files included one is for integer inputs and the other for 
double inputs. 

The makefile included uses the integer driver .cpp file; this can be easily 
modified by the user if need be by replacing the word Single_list_int_driver.cpp
by Single_list_double_driver.cpp.
