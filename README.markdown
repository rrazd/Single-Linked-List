###INTRODUCTION###

This is a project I did for my second year Data Structures and Algorithms
course. I added some extra functions for my own amusement. Although I
know I can optimize the code more, I am currently satisfied with it and
thus will let it rest in peace.


###NOTE###

There are two .cpp files included one is for integer inputs and the other for 
double inputs. 

The makefile included uses the integer driver .cpp file; this can be easily 
modified by the user if need be by replacing the word Single_list_int_driver.cpp
by Single_list_double_driver.cpp.  


###TO COMPILE AND RUN###

To compile and run the program simply download the files into one directory and
in the command prompt type in: make

To remove all new files created in order to compile the program type in: make clean

To test if program is working as it should type in: make run
