This is a project I did for my second year Data Structures and Algorithms
course. I added some extra functions for my own amusement. Although I
know I can optimize the code more, I am currently satisfied with it and
thus will let it rest in peace.

NOTE:

There are two .cpp files included one is for integer inputs and the other for 
double inputs. 
The makefile included uses the integer driver .cpp file; this can be easily 
modified if need be.
